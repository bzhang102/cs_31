a. Obstacles:
	For me at least, this project was deceptively easy... I thought I finished my project 
	in a single sitting of three hours, only to go back the next day and discover that I had 
	numerous small, but critical flaws in my errors including, but not limited to:
		1. Not handling leading and trailing paragraph breaks properly

		2. Not handling hyphens correctly when they are not trailed by spaces
			ii. Fixed by handling empty tokens after hyphens differently
b. Description:
c. Test Cases:
